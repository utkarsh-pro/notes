# Site for Notes
I already have a site for writing blogs but I wanted a place where I can just dump my thoughts without worrying about polishing them. I expect this site to be regularly updated with the things that I learn and I also expect myself to keep revisiting and updating the previous page.

The site has:
1. Tags - For me to quickly select all of the notes that have the same tag.
2. Archive - For me to revisit and probably identify most productive months.
3. Search - This is crucial. Dumping notes is important but being able to search through them easily is also very important and that's why unlike the blog site, this site has a WASM based search functionality built into it.

This UI/UX of the the site is mostly inspired (and to some extent copy pasted) from [https://devinschulz.com/](https://devinschulz.com/).

This blog uses:
1. Hugo for static side generation.
2. Sass for stylesheets (only because hugo has apparently better support for sass than for good old css).
3. [Pagefind](https://pagefind.app) for searches.

Lack of License on the repository is intentional. I am not sure about the content licensing and site licensing hence no license for now. Until a License is added, this repository remains open code but *unfortunately* not open source.
